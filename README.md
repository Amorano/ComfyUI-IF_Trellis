# ComfyUI-IF_Trellis
ComfyUI TRELLIS is a large 3D asset generation in various formats, such as Radiance Fields, 3D Gaussians, and meshes. The cornerstone of TRELLIS is a unified Structured LATent (SLAT) representation that allows decoding to different output formats and Rectified Flow Transformers tailored for SLAT as the powerful backbones.
